#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the design,development, testing and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Software Engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry.It enables the creation of software applications an d systems that solve real-world problems and power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of high-level Programming languages like Fortran in 1950, marked a significant shift from machine level coding, making it easier to write and understand code.
The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The rise of Agile Methodologies in 2001 revolutionized software development by prompting flexible, iterative development processes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Analysis: Gathering and documenting users need and system requirements.
Design: Creating architectural designs and software modela that outline the structure and components of the system. This include user and system interfaces
Implementation: Translating the design into executable code using a programming language.
Testing: Systematic evaluation of the software to identify defects (bugs) an d ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to end-users or customers
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support an d updates to the software to fix issues, improve performance or add new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY
   The waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear understanding of the final product.
AGILE METHODOLOGY
    Agile breaks the project into s mall, manageable chunks called sprints/iterations with frequent reassessments and customer feedback. Agile easily accommodate changes in requirements.
Agile is ideal for projects with evolving requirements e.g dynamic industry where customer feedback is crucial.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER 
   Role: Responsible for writing and maintaining the code that makes up the software application.
   Responsibilities: 
— Implementing software based on design specification.
— Debugging and resolving coding issues.
— Keeping up with the latest Programming practices and technologies.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
  Role: Ensures the software meets quality standards before it is released.
  Responsibilities:
— Designing and executing test plans and test cases.
— Identifying and documenting bugs or issues.
— Collaborating with developers to resolve defects.
PROJECT MANAGER
  Role: Oversees the software development project, ensuring it is completed on time, within scope and within budget.
  Responsibilities:
— Managing project resources, timeline and budgets
— Identifying and mitigating risks. 
— Planning and defining project scope and deliverables.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging and testing software, enhancing productivity and reducing errors.
Examples of IDEs:
—Visual Studio Code
—IntelliJ IDEA
Version Control Systems (VCS) allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, tracking changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
Examples of VCS
— Git
— Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Managing Technical Debt: Accumulating technical debt due to rushed development. 
This challenge can be overcomed by regularly refracting code and prioritizing critical technical debt.
2) Keeping up With Technological Changes:
The technology landscape is constantly evolving, requiring software engineers to continuously learn new tools and techniques.
This challenge could be overcomed by commiting to lifelong learning through online courses and attending conferences.
3) Balancing Feature Development and Testing:
Pressure to deliver new features quickly can lead to insufficient testing, increasing the risks of defects.
This challenge can be overcomed by adopting test-driven development practices and integrating automated testing into the CI / CD pipeline to ensure testing is as continuous part of development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit Testing
    Testing Individual units or components of the software to ensure they function as expected.
Importance: Helps catch bugs early in the development process, making it easier to isolate and fix issues.
2) Integration Testing
   Testing the interaction between integrated units of components to ensure they work together correctly.
Importance: Identifies issues that arise when different parts of the system interact, preventing system-level defect.
3) System Testing
   Testing the complete and integrated software to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Importance:  Ensures that the software behaves as as expected in a real-world environment, covering both functional and non-functional aspect.
4) Acceptance Testing
    Testing the software with the end-users or clients to ensure it meets their needs and requirements.
Importance: Validates that the software is ready for deployment and satisfies the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promt Engineering is the practice of refining and crafting questions/statements (prompts) to effectively interact with AI models and get the best possible responses from the AI models.
Importance :
— Clarity and Precision: Well engineered prompts reduce ambiguity leading to more precise and relevant responses from the AI
— Efficiency: Effective prompts save time by reducing the need for follow-up questions / corrections leading to more productive interactions.
— Bias Mitigation: Thoughtfully designed prompts can help mitigate unintended biases in AI-generated content by being inclusive and neutral.
— Customization: Prompt engineering allows you to tailor AI outputs to specific needs or contexts making the interaction more personalized and useful.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology"
Improved Prompt:
"Provide a brief overview of the impact of cloud computing on small businesses over the past decade, including key benefits and challenges."
The improved prompt is more effective due to the following:
— The improved prompt specifies the subject (Cloud Computing), the context (Impact on small businesses) and time frame (past decade), reducing ambiguity.
— The prompt asks for specific information (benefits and challenges), guiding the AI to focus on relevant details rather than a broad response.
— The improved prompt is direct and to the point, making it easier for the AI to understand what is required and deliver a coherent and concise answer.
